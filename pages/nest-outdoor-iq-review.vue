      <h1>Nest Outdoor IQ Camera Review</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class="post">
      <p>It's been 1 month since I bought the Nest IQ Outdoor camera and am keen to share my thoughts.</p>

      <p>In the past I've had the <a href="https://cocoon.life/">Cocoon camera</a> and the <a href="https://monitor.y-cam.com/login">Y Cam</a> camera.  
      The Cocoon camera was over £100 but didn't require any monthly subscription to store videos.  It's been OK but it's biggest flaw is the awful companion app.
      The Cocoon camera comes with a siren you can blast to deter an intruder but I lived in constant fear that I'd accidently trigger the siren when my daughter is sat nearby and triggered an alert.  
      There's no ability to turn off the siren and there's no web based to monitor the camera either, it's all done through the app.</p>

      <p>The Y cam was Ok as an entry level camera but quickly got returned when they did a 180 on their promise for free cloud storage and they started charging a monthly subscription.</p>

      <p>
        The Nest Outdoor IQ camera is by far the most expensive camera I've bought to date, retailing at £329 from John Lewis (UK) and Amazon.  
        To get the most out of it you probably need to sign up to Nest Aware from £5 a month.
        Normally such a subscription would scare me off purchase but the quality of the app seems to justify the price and you get a month's free trial when you first sign up.
        Notifications are split between 'people' and 'other movement'.  This means I can choose to only get notified when a person comes near my house and not everytime a car drives past.
        The best feature is the 24/7 recording.  I don't want to miss the first 30 seconds of an event and I want the quality of the footage to be smooth in terms of frames per second.

So far the camera has helped solve a few mysteries.  
I now know why my bin wasn't always being collected.  It simply wasn't being emptied properly and was being returned to the side of the street with rubbish still inside!
          </p>

Installation was fairly simple.  It requires a main power supply and thankfully I had a hole through to my front living room from when I had Virgin Media setup a few years ago.  
You can also buy some silicone covers to disguise your camera if you don't like the default white coating.
            </p>


            <p>
Overall the Nest Outdoor IQ is a great camera and is worth the premium price and monthly subscription.  I'm hoping the app will continue to improve with new features in the near future.
